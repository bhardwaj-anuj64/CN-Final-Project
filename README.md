## **CHAT Program with File Transfer**

### **How to Run:**

  In order to run the program, we use TCP and use two or more terminal windows on localhoast, one for each of the simulated users.
  After starting the terminal winodws, use the following commands:-
    
    1. To start the programs, enter "python project3.py" in the terminal windows.
    2. Enter your name, which would be shared to others when you connect.
    3. Enter your desired port number to be used by the receiving side (Server).
    4. Enter the port number of the client you want to chat with.

  After performing the above four steps in all the terminals, Users can chat with each other as usual.
  And when the message contains tansfer <filename>, the program will automatically upload the file with <filename>.
